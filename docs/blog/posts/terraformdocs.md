# `terraform-docs`: A Cool Way of Documenting Terraform Projects

## What Is It?
[terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/introduction/) is a utility that generates documentation from Terraform modules in various output formats. It allows you to easily integrate documentation that displays inputs, outputs, requirements, providers, and more! It supports several output formatsâ€”my personal favorite is Markdown.

## What Does It Look Like?
An example from the [official documentation](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/introduction/#:~:text=about%20configuration.-,Formats%23,-One%20of%20the) provides a clear illustration of how the module works, making it much easier for users to understand its usage. Below is an image demonstrating this example.

## Installation
As the installation process may change over time, please refer to the [official documentation](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/).

## Options
You need to define a `.config` directory inside the directory where you want to generate the documentation. In this file, we define:

- `formatter`: Set to Markdown, which I recommend.
- `output`: Set to `README.md`, which is the default file for displaying content in a repository.
- `sort`: To enable sorting of elements. We use the required criteria that sorts inputs by name and shows required ones first.
- `settings`: General settings to control the behavior and the generated output.
- `content`: The specific content to include in the documentation.

### Minimal Configuration
```yaml
formatter: "markdown"

output:
  file: "README.md"

sort:
  enabled: true
  by: required

settings:
  read-comments: false
  hide-empty: true
  escape: false

content: |-
  {{ .Requirements }}

  {{ .Modules }}

  {{ .Inputs }}

  {{ .Outputs }}
```

For more details about the configuration, please refer to [this guide](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/configuration/)

## Integration with Github Actions
To use `terraform-docs` with GitHub Actions, configure a YAML workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`) with the following content:
``` yaml
name: Generate terraform docs

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  terraform:
    name: "terraform docs"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Use the Bash shell regardless whether the GitHub Actions runner is ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, or windows-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash

    steps:
      # Checkout the repository to the GitHub Actions runner
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Install the latest version of Terraform CLI
      - name: Check docs
        uses: terraform-docs/gh-actions@v1.0.0
        with:
          output-file: README.md
          fail-on-diff: true
```

## See it in action
Here's an example of `terraform-docs` being used in a personal module I developed.

## Designing Relational Databases Visually with dbdiagram.io

When planning a relational database, the hardest part isn’t writing SQL—it’s **designing the schema**. Tables, relationships, primary/foreign keys… it’s easy to lose track of how everything connects. That’s where **[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io)** shines.

### 🧩 What is dbdiagram.io?

**dbdiagram.io** is a free, web-based tool for designing and visualizing relational databases. Instead of manually drawing ERDs or keeping schemas in your head, you can quickly build diagrams that represent your database structure—visually and with code.

---

### ✨ Why Use It?

- **Visual-first**: See your tables and relationships laid out clearly
- **Fast to write**: Uses a simple DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to define tables
- **Shareable**: Easy to share links or export diagrams for documentation
- **Import/Export**: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and more
- **Great for collaboration**: Perfect for design discussions or onboarding new devs

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

Here’s a quick example:

```dsl
Table users {
  id int [pk]
  name varchar
  email varchar
}

Table posts {
  id int [pk]
  user_id int [ref: > users.id]
  title varchar
  content text
}
```

This defines two tables (`users` and `posts`) with a one-to-many relationship.

The UI then auto-generates a clean, interactive diagram.

### 📥 Import from SQL

Already have a schema? Paste your SQL directly, and dbdiagram will parse it for you. Supported dialects include:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- SQL Server

---

### 📤 Export Options

You can export your diagrams as:

- **SQL** files (for running in a DB)
- **PNG/SVG** images (for documentation)
- **PDF** (for reports or specs)

---

### 🌐 Use Cases

- Prototyping database designs quickly
- Documenting existing databases visually
- Teaching or learning database design
- Improving dev–design–stakeholder collaboration
